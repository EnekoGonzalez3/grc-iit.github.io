# Jarvis-CD
Jarvis-CD is a unified platform for deploying various applications, including
storage systems and benchmarks. Many applications have complex configuration
spaces and are difficult to deploy across different machines.

We provide a builtin repo which contains various applications to deploy.
We refer to applications as "jarivs pkgs" which can be connected to form
"deployment pipelines".

## Installation

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="iowarp" label="IoWarp" default>
      If you installed iowarp already, Jarvis-CD is a dependency.
      No need to install anything further. Go to the next section.
    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="spack" label="Spack" default>
### Install Spack
```bash
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
cd spack
git checkout tags/v0.22.2
echo ". ${PWD}/share/spack/setup-env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Clone the IOWarp Spack Repo
```bash
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-install.git
spack repo add iowarp-install/iowarp-spack
```

### Install
```bash
spack external find python
spack install py-ppi-jarvis-cd
```

Spack packages must be loaded to use them.
You'll have to do this for each new terminal.
```bash
spack load py-ppi-jarvis-cd
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip">
### Jarvis-Util
Jarvis-CD depends on jarvis-util. jarvis-util contains functions to execute
binaries in python and collect their output.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grc-iit/jarvis-util.git
cd jarvis-util
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Jarvis-CD
```bash
cd /path/to/jarvis-cd
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Net Test
Network test tool for identifying valid networks.
```bash
spack install ppi-chi-nettest
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building the Jarvis Configuration

Jarvis packages provide 3 ways to configure Hermes:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="single" label="Single Machine" default>
### Bootstrapping for a single-node machine
For testing on a single node, use:
```bash
jarvis bootstrap from local
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="existing" label="Existing Machine">
### Bootstrapping from a specific machine
Jarvis has been pre-configured on some machines. This includes
machines at IIT, Sandia, and Argonne.

To bootstrap on one of them, run the following:
```bash 
jarvis bootstrap from [machine-name]
```

See available machines with:
```bash
jarvis bootstrap list
``` 

NOTE: If you are unsure which machine is yours, you probably should read the
New Configuration tab instead. Don't bootstrap from a random machine -- it will
break your deployments.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="new" label="New Configuration">
### Initialize jarvis configuration
A configuration can be generated as follows:
```bash
jarvis init [CONFIG_DIR] [PRIVATE_DIR] [SHARED_DIR]
```
* **CONFIG_DIR:** A directory where jarvis metadata for pkgs and pipelines
are stored. This directory can be anywhere that the current user can access.
* **PRIVATE_DIR:** A directory which is common across all machines, but
stores data locally to the machine. Some jarvis pkgs require certain data to
be stored per-machine. OrangeFS is an example.
* **SHARED_DIR:** A directory which is common across all machines, where
each machine has the same view of data in the directory.

For a personal machine, these directories can be the same directory.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Set or Change the active Hostfile

The hostfile contains the set of nodes that the pipeline will run over.
This is structured the same way as a traditional MPI hostfile.

An example hostfile:

```txt
ares-comp-20
ares-comp-[21-25]
```

To set the active hostfile, run:

```bash
jarvis hostfile set /path/to/hostfile
```

Note that every time you change the hostfile, you will need to update the
pipeline. Jarvis does not automatically detect changes to this file.

```bash
jarvis ppl update
```

## Set Up Passwordless SSH

When working with more than one node, passwordless SSH is nice-to-have. While most
HPC machines are already equipped with this, some types such as Chameleon Cloud,
Cloudlab, and other bare-metal deployments do not. Jarvis comes with some tools to help
bootstrap this. Here is an example for Chameleon.

Let's say that your chameleon node is 129.127.0.124. First, we need to copy the SSH key there.
```bash
jarvis ssh copy ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 129.127.0.124
```

Next, you have to copy that key to all nodes. First, construct a hostfile containing all nodes
you have allocated
```bash
jarvis hostfile set ~/hostfile.txt
```

Lastly, distribute the key. 
```bash
jarvis ssh distribute ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

## Building a Resource Graph

NOTE: This step only needs to be run if you did ``jarvis bootstrap from local`` or ``jarvis init``. 
If you bootstrap from a specific machine, then skip this section.

The resource graph is a snapshot of your systems network and storage.
Many packages depend on it for their configurations. The Hermes I/O system, for example,
uses this to identify valid networks and buffering locations.
```bash
jarvis rg build
```

This command only needs to be run once for the duration of Jarvis (or whenever your resources change).
For example, if you get a new hard drive, you should re-run this command.

NOTE: Make sure the hostfile contains a representative set of nodes. General rules:
1. If you are trying to do multi-node deployments, make sure the hostfile contains
at least two nodes before running this command. This will allow us to introspect
valid networks between hosts.
2. In addition, make sure that the nodes are representative of the machine. For example,
if you plan to do multi-node deployments, the master node probably should not even
be introspected.
