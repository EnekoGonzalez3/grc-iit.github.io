# Overview

WisIO (Wisdom from I/O Behavior) is an open-source tool that helps HPC users and system administrators identify and analyze I/O bottlenecks in their applications. By analyzing your workflow performance data, WisIO automatically detects performance issues and pinpoints their root causes through comprehensive I/O analysis.

## What WisIO Solves

As an HPC user or system administrator, you may encounter these common I/O challenges:

- **Unexplained performance degradation** during application runs with unclear causes
- **Complex I/O patterns** across distributed resources that are difficult to analyze manually
- **Large volumes of performance data** that are overwhelming to sift through
- **Hidden bottlenecks** that standard profiling tools might miss
- **Resource underutilization** due to unoptimized I/O strategies

## How WisIO Works

WisIO makes analyzing complex I/O issues simple with a straightforward workflow:

```mermaid

    A[Run Your Application] --> B[Collect I/O Traces]
    B --> C[Run WisIO Analysis]
    C --> D[Review Insights]
    D --> E[Apply Fixes]
    E --> F[Verify Improvements]
```

### Simple 4-Step Process

1. **Collect**: Run your HPC application with Darshan or another I/O tracer
2. **Analyze**: Feed your trace data into WisIO
3. **Review**: Examine the detailed bottleneck reports
4. **Optimize**: Apply changes to your application or system based on the analysis

The entire process is designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive to your workflow, with minimal setup required.

## Key Features

### Multi-Perspective Analysis

WisIO doesn't just look at your I/O problems from one angle - it examines them from multiple perspectives to ensure nothing is missed:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your I/O Trace Data] --> B{WisIO Analysis Engine}
    
    subgraph "Multiple Perspectives"
        B --> C["When: Time-Based<br>• Peak traffic periods<br>• Periodic slowdowns<br>• Burst I/O patterns"]
        B --> D["Who: Process-Based<br>• Load imbalances<br>• Communication bottlenecks<br>• Process coordination"]
        B --> E["What: File-Based<br>• Small I/O operations<br>• Poor file organization<br>• File sharing conflicts"]
    end
      C --> G[Comprehensive Diagnosis]
    D --> G
    E --> G
```

This approach finds issues that would be missed by tools that only look at a single aspect of I/O performance. For example, a bottleneck might only appear when specific processes access particular files during certain time periods - WisIO can detect these complex patterns.

### Smart Diagnostics Engine

WisIO's intelligent analysis engine doesn't just find problems - it explains them in detail:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Your Trace Data"] --> B["WisIO Analysis Engine"]
    B --> C["Problem Detection"]
    C --> D["Root Cause Analysis"]
    D --> E["Severity Ranking"]
    E --> F["Clear Diagnosis"]
    
    G["Extensible Rules<br>(Add Your Own)"] -.-> B
```

The diagnostics engine:

- Prioritizes issues based on their impact on performance
- Provides detailed analysis of detected bottlenecks
- Explains problems in clear, human-readable language
- Allows you to add custom rules for your specific environment

### Designed for Scale

WisIO handles your data efficiently, no matter how large your workflow:

- **Fast Analysis**: Process multi-terabyte datasets in minutes rather than hours
- **Out-of-Core Processing**: Works well even on systems with limited memory
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes available computing resources to speed up analysis

## Who Should Use WisIO

WisIO is ideal for:

- **HPC Application Developers** looking to optimize I/O performance
- **System Administrators** trying to diagnose storage bottlenecks
- **Researchers** working with data-intensive scientific workflows

## Use Cases

Here are some common scenarios where WisIO helps users:

1. **Application Performance Analysis**: "My simulation runs slower than expected and I don't know why."
   - *WisIO identifies unbalanced I/O patterns and provides detailed diagnostics*

2. **Storage System Analysis**: "Our file system performance isn't matching the hardware specifications."
   - *WisIO reveals specific I/O patterns that impact system performance*

3. **Workflow Investigation**: "Some stages of our pipeline are much slower than others."
   - *WisIO pinpoints where and when bottlenecks occur in multi-stage workflows*
