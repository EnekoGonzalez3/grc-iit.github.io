This installer is experimental and will be improving as we add Windows support.
Spack is the most well-maintained installer at this time. However, these are
the general steps for vcpkg.

### Install vcpkg + add our ports
```bash
git clone  --branch 2025.03.19 --single-branch https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cp -r iowarp-install/ports/* ./vcpkg/ports/
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export PATH="${PWD}:${PATH}"
```

### Install IOWarp
```bash
./vcpkg install content-transfer-engine
```
