This is for anyone building extensions to iowarp or working on its
core components (e.g., iowarp-runtime, content-transfer-engine, etc.).

### Project Environment

Decide on where you want to place your iowarp repos.
This guide will assume you have set a variable named IOWARP.

```bash
export IOWARP="${HOME}"
```

Set IOWARP to where you want your packages.

NOTE: This variable needs to be reset for every new terminal.
On Linux, you could add the above command to your `~/.bashrc`
to automate.
