This is for people that will be editing either cte-hermes-shm, 
iowarp-runtime, or content-transfer-engine directly. If you
are developing something relying on these repos, install
iowarp like a regular user instead. E.g., developing the CAE,
PPI, or some  other runtime plugin.

### Project Environment

Decide on where you want to place your iowarp repos.
This guide will assume you have set a variable named IOWARP.

```bash
export IOWARP="${HOME}"
```

Set IOWARP to where you want your packages.

NOTE: This variable needs to be reset for every new terminal.
On Linux, you could add the above command to your `~/.bashrc`
to automate.

### Clone the IOWarp Spack Repo

```bash
cd ${IOWARP}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-install.git
```

### Clone the repos

```bash
cd ${IOWARP}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/cte-hermes-shm.git
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-runtime
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/content-transfer-engine.git
```

### For Pull Requests

You may find the github [command line](https://cli.github.com/) useful for making PRs.

```bash
gh auth login
gh repo set-default
gh pr create --title "Your pull request title" --body "Your pull request description"
```
