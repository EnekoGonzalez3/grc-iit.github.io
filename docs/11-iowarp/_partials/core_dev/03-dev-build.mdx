import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

### Load Basic Packages

```bash
spack load iowarp
```

Make sure to understand your environment. If you get errors
like `package X was not found`, it is most likely you forgot
to do either `spack load X` or `module load X`.

### Setup Repo Environments

```bash
./wrpgit setup
```

This will construct modulefiles and environments for each of the packages.
You should rerun this if you spack packages or any dependencies of iowarp.

### Build + Install Repos

```bash
./wrpgit build
````

This will build and install all repos with ``build: True``. 

### Clean Build Directories

```bash
./wrpgit clean
```

This will destroy all build directories.
You should rerun this if you spack packages or any dependencies of iowarp.

### Recreate Modules

```bash
./wrpgit recreate
```

Modules are created using scspkg. These are used to store the "installed" files (e.g., cmake install).
However, these can become corrupted too. This will destroy scspkgs and then rebuild them.

### For Pull Requests

You may find the github [command line](https://cli.github.com/) useful for making PRs.

```bash
gh auth login
gh repo set-default
gh pr create --title "Your pull request title" --body "Your pull request description"
```
