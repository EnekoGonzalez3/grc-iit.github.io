# Configure Jarvis

The Content Transfer Engine, which we refer to as Hermes, runs in the iowarp runtime.
Hermes is responsible for tracking various metadata, and it is
required to be launched before your application. There should only be
one Hermes daemon per node. We use the platform plugin interface's
Jarvis-CD to deploy hermes, which is installed automatically if you used spack
or the containers.

Jarvis-CD is a tool that manages the deployment of complex software. This includes
setting environment variables and identifying the resources on your system. It
is important to configure Jarvis properly before proceeding with Hermes deployments.

Read [this guide](../../../81-jarvis/02-jarvis-cd/01-index.mdx#building-the-jarvis-configuration)
to learn how to bootstrap Jarvis.

The next few sections will demonstrate how to use jarvis to deploy Hermes.
