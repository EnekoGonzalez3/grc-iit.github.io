# Overview

IoWarp is a platform that manages the placement of data in complex storage. 
The main components that enable this currently are:
1. The IoWarp Runtime (Chimaera): where most IoWarp-related services run
2. The Content Transfer Engine (Hermes): which provides algorithms to place data and manage metadata
3. The Platform Plugins Interface (Jarvis): which introspects machines and build scripts to deploy Chimaera and Hermes.

This guide goes over the following:
1. How to configure Jarvis to learn your machine's resources so it can deploy IoWarp
2. How to build a Jarvis Pipeline to run IoWarp
3. How to build a Jarvis Pipeline to run IoWarp with an application
