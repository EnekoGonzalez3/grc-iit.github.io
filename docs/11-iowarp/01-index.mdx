# Getting Started

## IOWarp

IOWarp is a powerful cutting-edge data management platform designed to streamline and accelerate scientific workflows,
especially those intensified by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). It optimizes data flow throughout the research
process, ensuring efficient handling of diverse data types, formats, and the exponential growth of data. IOWarp aims to
significantly reduce data access times, accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, and foster a collaborative research
environment.

## Dependencies

Currently, IOWarp is Linux-only. We are working on extending portability.

[Spack](https://spack.io/) is the easiest way to install IOWarp as of right now.

We also have a set of docker containers.

## Installation

### Clone the IOWarp Install Repo

```bash
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-install.git
```


<Tabs>   
  <TabItem value="user" label="User" default>
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="spack-user" label="Spack (Linux-Only)" default>
### Install Spack
```bash
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
cd spack
git checkout tags/v0.22.2
echo ". ${PWD}/share/spack/setup-env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Add IOWarp to Spack
```bash
spack repo add iowarp-install/iowarp-spack
```

## Install IOWarp

```bash
spack install iowarp
```

      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="vcpkg-user" label="Vcpkg (Linux-Only)">
This installer is experimental and will be improving as we add Windows support.
Spack is the most well-maintained installer at this time. However, these are
the general steps for vcpkg.

### Install vcpkg + add our ports
```bash
git clone  --branch 2025.03.19 --single-branch https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cp -r iowarp-install/ports/* ./vcpkg/ports/
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export PATH="${PWD}:${PATH}"
```

### Install IOWarp
```bash
./vcpkg install content-transfer-engine
```
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="podman-user" label="Manual Podman (Any)">
### Clone the IOWarp Install Repo

    </Tabs>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="developer" label="Core Developer" default>
This is for people that will be editing either cte-hermes-shm, 
iowarp-runtime, or content-transfer-engine directly. If you
are developing something relying on these repos, install
iowarp like a regular user instead. E.g., developing the CAE,
PPI, or some  other runtime plugin.

### Project Environment

Decide on where you want to place your iowarp repos.
This guide will assume you have set a variable named IOWARP_PKGS.

```bash
export IOWARP_PKGS="${HOME}"
```

Set IOWARP_PKGs to where you want your packages.

NOTE: This variable needs to be reset for every new terminal.
On Linux, you could add the above command to your `~/.bashrc`
to automate.

### Clone the IOWarp Spack Repo

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-install.git
```

### Clone the repos

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/cte-hermes-shm.git
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-runtime
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/content-transfer-engine.git
```

### For Pull Requests

You may find the github [command line](https://cli.github.com/) useful for making PRs.

```bash
gh auth login
gh repo set-default
gh pr create --title "Your pull request title" --body "Your pull request description"
```

### Install Dependencies

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="spack-dev" label="Spack (Linux-Only)" default>

#### Install Spack

```bash
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
cd spack
git checkout tags/v0.22.2
echo ". ${PWD}/share/spack/setup-env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Add iowarp to spack

```bash
spack repo add ${IOWARP_PKGS}/iowarp-install/iowarp-spack
```

#### Install Dependencies

To install iowarp dependencies:

```bash
spack install iowarp +nocompile
```

For developer installations, we will use a tool named scspkg.
scspkg is installed automatically by iowarp. It is a tool for
managing modulefiles, which set various environment variables
that streamline the installation of our tools.

</TabItem>

      <TabItem value="docker-dev" label="Dockerfiles (Any)">

#### Build Containers

```bash
# iowarp-base
docker build --no-cache -t iowarp-base . -f iowarp-base.Dockerfile
docker tag iowarp-base iowarp/iowarp-base:latest
# iowarp-deps-spack
docker build --no-cache -t iowarp-deps-spack . -f iowarp-deps-spack.Dockerfile
docker tag iowarp-deps-spack iowarp/iowarp-deps-spack:latest
# iowarp-deps
docker build --no-cache -t iowarp-deps . -f iowarp-deps.Dockerfile
docker tag iowarp-deps iowarp/iowarp-deps:latest
#iowarp-user
docker build --no-cache -t iowarp-user . -f iowarp-user.Dockerfile
docker tag iowarp-user iowarp/iowarp-user:latest
```

#### Launch Docker Compose

```bash
mkdir -p ${IOWARP_PKGS}/docker
cp -r ${IOWARP_PKGS}/iowarp-install/docker/development ${IOWARP_PKGS}/docker
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/docker/development
# Copy-paste the above into the file
docker compose up -d  # Only for recent dockers
docker-compose up -d  # Only for older dockers
```

Feel free to edit `${IOWARP_PKGS}/docker/development/docker-compose.yml`.
It assumes the environment variable `${IOWARP_PKGS}` is set.

NOTE: `shm_size` and `mem_limit` are set to 8GB. Feel free to increase or decrease
that value.

#### Access the Container

```bash
docker exec -it iowarp bash
```

      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

### Load Basic Packages

```bash
spack load iowarp
```

Make sure to understand your environment. If you get errors
like `package X was not found`, it is most likely you forgot
to do either `spack load X` or `module load X`.

### Configure SCSPKG

Read [this](https://grc.iit.edu/docs/jarvis/scspkg/index) guide to configure scspkg.

### Ensure packages are up-to-date

Make sure to try and update all your packages:

```bash
cd ~/iowarp-install
git pull
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/cte-hermes-shm
git pull
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/iowarp-runtime
git pull
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/content-transfer-engine
git pull
```

### Things failing to build after an update

If you find that things are failing to build for you
after an update, try destroying all build directories.

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/cte-hermes-shm
rm -rf build
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/iowarp-runtime
rm -rf build
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/content-transfer-engine
rm -rf build
```

### Hermes-SHM

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/cte-hermes-shm
scspkg create hermes_shm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(scspkg pkg root hermes_shm) \
-DHSHM_ENABLE_COMPRESS=ON \
-DHSHM_ENABLE_ENCRYPT=ON \
-DHSHM_RPC_THALLIUM=ON \
-DHSHM_USE_ELF=ON
make -j32 install
```

If you will be working on hermes-shm, create your own personal
fork instead of cloning directly. The following will allow
you to keep your fork updated with changes to the global repo.

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/cte-hermes-shm
git remote add iowarp https://github.com/iowarp/cte-hermes-shm.git
git pull iowarp
```

### IOWarp Runtime: Chimaera

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/iowarp-runtime
scspkg create iowarp_runtime
module unload iowarp_runtime
module load hermes_shm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(scspkg pkg root iowarp_runtime)
make -j32 install
```

NOTE: If you will be working on iowarp-runtime, create your own personal
fork instead of cloning directly. The following will allow
you to keep your fork updated with changes to the global repo.

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/iowarp-runtime
git remote add iowarp https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-runtime
git pull iowarp
```

### Content-Transfer-Engine: Hermes

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/content-transfer-engine
scspkg create cte
module unload cte
module load hermes_shm iowarp_runtime
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(scspkg pkg root cte)
make -j32 install
```

NOTE: If you will be working on the cte, create your own personal
fork instead of cloning directly. The following will allow
you to keep your fork updated with changes to the global repo.

```bash
cd ${IOWARP_PKGS}/content-transfer-engine
git remote add iowarp https://github.com/iowarp/content-transfer-engine.git
git pull iowarp
```

### Another note on environments

By the end of this installation, you will have the following spack:

```bash
spack load iowarp
```

And the following modules:

```bash
module load hermes_shm iowarp_runtime cte
```

Understanding how your environment works is important. When
compiling you must make sure that only the necessary modules
are loaded. For example, the iowarp_runtime install only
requires `spack load iowarp` and `module load hermes_shm`.

If you have `module load iowarp_runtime` as well,
there is a chance the compiler will find header files
in the module's directory, instead of the build directory.
This can lead to compilation errors since the module directory
will likely be outdated compared to the code you just wrote.
