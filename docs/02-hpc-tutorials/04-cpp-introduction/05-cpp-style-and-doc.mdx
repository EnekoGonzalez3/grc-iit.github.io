# C++ Style and Documentation
This section introduces a **style guide** for consistently phrasing and documenting
C++ code. Consistency is key to making a codebase readable. You don't want the
code to look like it was written by a 100 different people.

If you don't know any C++, you shouldn't read this section very carefully yet.
We use this style in our C++ code examples. However, be aware that part of
professionally developing code is being consistent.

We use the [Google C++ Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). We won't repeat every
single rule, but we'll give you the highlights to get started. Make sure to read
through their style document thoroughly.

## General Style Rules

### Function Names

Function names should be camel case.
```cpp
void MyFunction() {
}
```

### Function Variable Names

Function variable names should be snake case:
```cpp
void MyFunction() {
  int my_var;
}
```

### Class Names

Class names should be camel case.
```cpp
class Hello;
```

### Method Names

Method names should be camel case
```cpp
class Hello {
 public:
  void MyFunction() {
  }
}
```

### Class Variable Names

Class variable names should be snake case and be appended with a trailing "_".
The underscore makes it so that we know this is a variable of the class, and not
just a typical variable stored on the stack.

```cpp
class Hello {
  int my_var_;
};
```

### Namespaces

Generally, classes should be encapsulated in a namespace. This avoids
accidental conflicts across packages.

Namespaces are snake case. Namespaces must also be terminated using
a comment which states the name of the namespace.

```cpp
namespace my_namespace {

}  // namespace my_namespace
```

### Enumerations

Enumerations should be camel case. Enumeration entries should begin with
a lowercase k.
```cpp
enum class MyFruitEnum {
  kApple,
  kOrange
  kDragonFruit
};
```

### Macros

Macros should be snake case and all caps. Macros should be used sparingly
since they are much harder to debug. The most common use of macros is
for defining constants.

```cpp
#define MY_MACRO 25
```

Macro function parameters should be snake case and all caps as well.
```cpp
#define MY_MACRO(A, B)
```

### Conditionals & Loops

Whenever making a conditional, ensure there is a single space between the keyword and the parenthesis.
```cpp
// This is BAD
if(true) {
  std::cout << "hello" << std::endl;
}

// This is GOOD
if (true) {
  std::cout << "hello1" << std::endl;
} else if (false) {
  std::cout << "hello2" << std::endl;
} else {
  std::cout << "hello3" << std::endl;
}

// This is GOOD
while (true) {
  std::cout << "hello" << std::endl;
}

// This is GOOD
do {

} while (true);
```

### Binary Operators

Binary operators such as =, +, -, *, /, etc. should have a space on both the left and right side.

```cpp
// GOOD
int c = a + b

// BAD
int c=a+b;
```

## Linting

To ensure that your code is consistent, you can use [cpplint.py](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#cpplint).
Cpplint is a python script which can inspect codebases for stylistic errors.
It can be installed as follows:
```bash
python3 -m pip install cpplint
```

```cpp
// Copyright [year] <Copyright Owner>

#ifndef MY_HEADER_GUARD
#define MY_HEADER_GUARD

namespace my_namespace {

class MyName {
  int my_var_;

  void MyFunc() {
    int hi;
  }
};

}

#endif
```

This violates the rule that the namespace is missing the namespace comment.
cpplint can be executed as follows to detect this error:
```bash
cd ${GRC_TUTORIAL}/cpp/04-cpp-basic-syntax
cpplint --recursive src/cpplint_test.h
```

Output:
```
src/cpplint_test.h:16:  Namespace should be terminated with "// namespace myNamespace"  [readability/namespace] [5]
Done processing src/cpplint_test.h
Total errors found: 1
```

You can tune the set of errors cpplint checks for by creating a CPPLINT.cfg
file.

## Documentation

Code documentation is important to improve the readability of code and to
give some guidance on how to interpret the codebase. AI models, for example,
can crawl well-documented codebases to help provide examples.

The most used documentation format is called Doxygen.
