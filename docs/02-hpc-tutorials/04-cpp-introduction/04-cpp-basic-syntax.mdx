# C++ Basic Syntax
In this section, we will discuss some basic concepts of C and C++.
We discuss both C and C++ since you will likely see both.

## Builtin Numeric Types

C++ has a number of builtin integer types.

|Keyword|Description|  
|-------|----------|
|char|A signed 1-byte integer. Can represent ASCII character codes. Always 1 byte.|
|int|A signed integer. Typically 4 bytes.|
|float|A fractional number. Typically 4 bytes.|
|double|A large fractional number. Typically 8 bytes.|

```cpp
int main() {
  int x;
  float x;
  double x;
}
```

There are also *modifiers* which can be applied to these types. There
are two primary types of modifiers: *sign* modifiers and *size* modifiers.

*sign* modifiers apply to int and char specifically.

|Keyword|Description|  
|-------|----------|
|signed|The number can be negative|  
|unsigned|The number cannot be negative|

*size* modifiers apply to int and double types specifically.

|Keyword|Description|Applies to doubles?|  
|-------|----------|------------|
|short|Decrease length of type|No|
|long|Increase length of type|Yes|
|long long|Increase length of type more|Yes|

Below are a few examples of the above:
```cpp
int main() {
  // int examples
  long int a;
  long long int b;
  unsigned int c;
  long unsigned int d;
  unsigned long int e;
  short int f;
  short g;
  long h;

  // Double examples
  long double g;
  long long double h;
}
```

## Sized Types

Certain types are guaranteed to have a specific size. They are included
in the *stdint.h* header file. Having a specific size to types is frequently
useful.

|Keyword|Description|
|-------|----------|
|int8_t|Signed 8-bit integer|
|int16_t|Signed 16-bit integer|
|int32_t|Signed 32-bit integer|
|int64_t|Signed 64-bit integer|
|uint8_t|Unsigned 8-bit integer|
|uint16_t|Unsigned 16-bit integer|
|uint32_t|Unsigned 32-bit integer|
|uint64_t|Unsigned 64-bit integer|

Examples are below:
```cpp
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
  int8_t a;
  int16_t b;
  uint64_t c;
}
```

## Simple Arrays

Arrays provide a way to define many instances of a single type quickly. Arrays
are stored on the stack, and have limited space. Typically, an array shouldn't
exceed more than 16KB of memory. This is not a hard rule, but I find it to be
generally safe.  Larger allocations should be made on the heap using a memory
allocator, which is described later.

An example is below:
```cpp
int main() {
  int hello[24];

  hello[0] = 0;
  hello[1] = 0;
}
```
We create an array containing 24 ints. We then set the first two elements
of the array to 0.

Arrays can also be initialized as follows:
```cpp
int main() {
  int hello[24] = {
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0
  };

  int hello2[24] = {0};
}
```
The first five elements of *hello* are initialized to 0 through 5. Elements 6
and onwards are initialized to 0.

For *hello2*, all elements are initialized to 0.

## Structs

structs can be used to logically group data.

For example, we can create a struct to represent a wallet. The wallet contains
money (in cents), driver's license, and a health insurance card.
```cpp
#include <stdint.h>

struct Wallet {
  uint8_t cents_;
  char license_[32];
  char health_id_[32];
};  // notice the ; here

int main() {
  struct Wallet wallet;
  wallet.pennies_ = 200;
  strcpy(wallet.license_, "dontpullmeover");
  strcpy(wallet.health_id_, "donthurtme");
}
```
Our wallet contains 200 cents, a license with the text "dontpullmeover",
and a health insure ID which states "donthurtme".

In addition, structs can be initialized using a special syntax to reduce lines
of code. Here we initialize the Lemonade struct. The lemonade can have a certain
amount of sugar, water, lemon juice, and coloring.
```cpp
struct Lemonade {
  int sugar_;  // grams
  int water_;  // mL
  int lemon_;  // mL
  int color_[3];  // (Red, Green, Blue)
}

int main() {
  // NOTE: 255, 255, 0 is yellow on the RGB color wheel
  struct Lemonade sour = {0, 100, 10,
                          255,255,0};
  struct Lemonade sweet = {20, 100, 10,
                           255,255,0};
}
```

## Memory Allocation and Pointers

### Malloc + Free

The very vast majority of data must be stored using a memory allocator.
The C-style way to do this is with malloc and free. Generally, it's
bad practice to directly use ```malloc``` and ```free```. However, sometimes
it is unavoidable. ```malloc``` allocates memory, ```free``` releases memory.
When you fail to release memory using ```free```, it is referred to as a
**memory leak**.

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>  // malloc + free
#include <cstring>  // memset

int main() {
  // Allocate
  int *data = (int*)malloc(64 * sizeof(int));
  // Clear
  memset(data, 0, 64 * sizeof(int));

  // Set integer 10 to 15
  data[10] = 15;

  // Allocate + clear
  int *data2 = (int*)calloc(64, sizeof(int));

  // Set integer 10 to 15
  data2[10] = 15;
```
