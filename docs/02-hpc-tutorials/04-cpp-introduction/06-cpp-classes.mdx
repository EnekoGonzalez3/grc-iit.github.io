# C++ Classes
In this section, we will discuss the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP)
in C++. A class represents a set of functions (i.e., methods) and data for those
methods. An object is an instance of a class.

* Class variables
* Methods
* Encapsulation:
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Operator overloading

## Defining a Class
In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that combines data members (variables) and member functions (methods) into a single unit. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. Here's a simple example of defining a class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
public:
    // Data members
    double length;
    double width;

    // Member functions
    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }

    double perimeter() {
        return 2 * (length + width);
    }
};
```
## Constructors
Constructors are special member functions used to initialize objects of a class. Here's an example of a constructor for the Rectangle class:

```cpp
Rectangle::Rectangle(double l, double w) {
    length = l;
    width = w;
}

// Usage
int main() {
    Rectangle r(5.0, 3.0); // Creating a Rectangle object with specified dimensions
    cout << "Area: " << r.area() << endl;
    cout << "Perimeter: " << r.perimeter() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## Destructor
In C++, a destructor is a special member function that gets called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Here's an example:

```cpp
Rectangle::~Rectangle() {
    cout << "Rectangle object destroyed" << endl;
}

// Usage
int main() {
    Rectangle r(5.0, 3.0);
    // r goes out of scope here, and the destructor is called automatically
    return 0;
}
```
## Operator Overloading
Operator overloading allows you to define how operators like +, -, *, and others behave with objects of your class. Here's an example of overloading the + operator for the Rectangle class:

```cpp
Rectangle operator+(const Rectangle& r1, const Rectangle& r2) {
    Rectangle result;
    result.length = r1.length + r2.length;
    result.width = r1.width + r2.width;
    return result;
}

// Usage
int main() {
    Rectangle r1(5.0, 3.0);
    Rectangle r2(2.0, 4.0);
    Rectangle sum = r1 + r2; // Using the overloaded + operator
    cout << "Sum of rectangles: Area=" << sum.area() << ", Perimeter=" << sum.perimeter() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### Assignment Operators
In C++, you can overload assignment operators (=, +=, -=) to define custom behavior for objects of your class during assignment. This allows you to control how your objects are copied or modified.

Example:

```cpp
class MyNumber {
private:
    int value;

public:
    MyNumber(int v) : value(v) {}

    // Overloading the assignment operator '='
    MyNumber& operator=(const MyNumber& other) {
        if (this == &other) // Self-assignment check
            return *this;
        
        value = other.value;
        return *this;
    }
};
```
In this example, we overload the assignment operator to ensure that self-assignment is handled gracefully.

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, /, and % can be overloaded to define custom arithmetic operations for objects of your class.

Example:

```cpp
class Complex {
private:
    double real;
    double imaginary;

public:
    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imaginary(i) {}

    // Overloading the addition operator '+'
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imaginary + other.imaginary);
    }
};
```
In this example, we overload the addition operator to perform complex number addition.

### Relational Operators
Relational operators (``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``) can be overloaded to define custom comparison logic for objects of your class.

Example:

```cpp
class Student {
private:
    int id;

public:
    Student(int studentId) : id(studentId) {}

    // Overloading the equality operator '=='
    bool operator==(const Student& other) const {
        return id == other.id;
    }
};
```
In this example, we overload the equality operator to compare student objects based on their IDs.

### Member Access Operators
Member access operators (-> and .) can be overloaded to customize how you access members of objects of your class.

Example:

```cpp
class MyString {
private:
    char* str;

public:
    MyString(char* s) : str(s) {}

    // Overloading the member access operator '->'
    char operator[](size_t index) const {
        return str[index];
    }
};
```
In this example, we overload the member access operator to access individual characters of a string-like object.

### Function Call
You can overload the function call operator () to make objects of your class callable like functions.

Example:

```cpp
class MyFunction {
public:
    int operator()(int x, int y) const {
        return x + y;
    }
};
```
In this example, we overload the function call operator to create an object that behaves like a function, adding two integers.

### Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) can be overloaded to define custom bitwise operations for objects of your class.

Example:

```cpp
class Bitset {
private:
    unsigned int data;
