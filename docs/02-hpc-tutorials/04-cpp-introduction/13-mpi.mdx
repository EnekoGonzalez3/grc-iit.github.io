# Intro to MPI

MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed for parallel computing. It enables communication between processes in distributed memory systems, making it essential for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications.

Key features of MPI include:
- Process-based parallelism
- Point-to-point communication
- Collective operations
- Support for both SPMD and MPMD programming models

MPI is widely used in scientific computing, engineering simulations, and data analysis across HPC clusters. While it requires explicit management of parallelism, it offers excellent performance and scalability.

Common MPI implementations:
- OpenMPI
- MPICH
- Intel MPI
- Microsoft MPI

## Linking to MPI in CMake

To link with MPI in CMake, add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(MPI REQUIRED)
add_executable(your_program main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_program PRIVATE MPI::MPI_CXX)
```

This will:
1. Find MPI installation on your system
2. Create your executable
3. Link MPI libraries to your program

## Ranks + Communicators

```cpp
#include <mpi.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    int rank, size;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    std::cout << "Process " << rank << " of " << size << std::endl;

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run:
```bash
mpic++ mpi_example.cpp -o mpi_example
mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_example
```

The output of this should be
```bash
Process 0 of 4
Process 1 of 4
Process 2 of 4
Process 3 of 4
```

In MPI, a **rank** is a unique identifier assigned to each process in a parallel program. Ranks are integers starting from 0, allowing processes to identify themselves and determine their specific roles in the program.

A **communicator** is a context that defines a group of processes that can communicate with each other. The most common communicator is `MPI_COMM_WORLD`, which includes all processes in the application. Communicators enable:
- Process organization
- Safe message passing
- Collective operations across specific process groups

## Barrier

A barrier is a synchronization point where all processes must arrive before any can proceed. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <mpi.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    int rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);

    // Simulate work with sleep
    sleep(rank);
    std::cout << "Process " << rank << " reached barrier" << std::endl;

    // Wait for all processes
    MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

    std::cout << "Process " << rank << " passed barrier" << std::endl;

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run:
```bash
mpic++ mpi_barrier.cpp -o mpi_barrier
mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_barrier
```

Example output:
```bash
Process 0 reached barrier
Process 1 reached barrier
Process 2 reached barrier
Process 3 reached barrier
Process 0 passed barrier
Process 1 passed barrier
Process 2 passed barrier
Process 3 passed barrier
```


## Reduction

Below is an example of using MPI to calculate the maximum value across processes and then print in the first:

```cpp
#include <mpi.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    int rank, size;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    // Use rank as the local value
    int local_value = rank;

    std::cout << "Process " << rank << " has value: " << local_value << std::endl;

    // Find the maximum value across all processes
    int global_max;
    MPI_Reduce(&local_value, &global_max, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_MAX, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

    // Only the root process (rank 0) prints the result
    if (rank == 0) {
        std::cout << "Maximum value across all processes: " << global_max << std::endl;
    }

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run:
```bash
mpic++ mpi_reduction.cpp -o mpi_reduction
mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_reduction
```

Example output:
```bash
Process 0 has value: 0
Process 1 has value: 1
Process 2 has value: 2
Process 3 has value: 3
Maximum value across all processes: 3
```
