# StoreHub

<ProjectBadges projectId="storehub" />

StoreHub is a collaborative platform designed to advance data storage research by providing a specialized infrastructure that meets the unique needs of researchers.
It brings together experts handling large amounts of data, focusing on I/O performance, and developing innovative storage solutions, making it a vital resource for the community.

## Project Motivation

Large-scale applications in scientific, Big Data, and AI communities present unique data storage requirements that existing solutions struggle to address.
Modern storage systems are rapidly evolving, leading to heterogeneous storage resources where data movement becomes complex and performance-dominant.

- Infrastructure isolation is essential for capturing subsystem impacts.
- Customized and flexible hardware compositions are needed to emulate various machine models.
- Hardware heterogeneity is vital for assessing research impacts across diverse hardware designs.
- Programmable hardware is transforming modern software solutions.

## Project Summary

Our goal is to establish, nurture, and sustain a vibrant research community centered on data storage research.
We intend to support this community with StoreHub, an adaptable infrastructure equipped with experimental hardware and cutting-edge software.
Our objectives include:

- Flexible storage hardware composition
- Ease of use and deployment
- Responsive support system
- Training opportunities

## Project Significance

The significance of StoreHub is three-fold:

- CISE researchers gain access to premier infrastructure for data storage research.
- Uniting CISE researchers into a research community to collectively address the I/O bottleneck.
- Early access to prototype devices from vendors, enhancing creativity and output.
