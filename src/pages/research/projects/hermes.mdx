# Hermes: Extending the HDF Library to Support Intelligent I/O Buffering for Deep Memory and Storage Hierarchy System

<ProjectBadges projectId="hermes" />

To reduce the I/O bottleneck, complex storage hierarchies have been introduced. However, managing this complexity should not
be left to application developers. Hermes is a middeware library that automatically manages buffering in heterogeneous storage
environments.

## Background

Today's multi-tiered environments demonstrate:

- **Complex data placement among the tiers of a deep memory and storage hierarchy**
  - Lack of automated data movement between tiers, is now left to the users
  - Lack of intelligent data placement in the DMSH
- **Independent management of each tier of the DMSH**
  - Lack of expertise from the user
  - Lack of existing software for managing tiers of heterogeneous buffers
  - Lack of native buffering support in HDF5

Deep memory and storage hierarchy (DMSH) systems requires:

- Efficient and transparent data movement through the hierarchy
- New data placement algorithms
- Effective memory and metadata management
- An efficient communication fabric

## Synopsis

Modern high performance computing (HPC) applications generate massive amounts of data. However, the performance improvement of
disk based storage systems has been much slower than that of memory, creating a significant Input/Output (I/O) performance gap.
To reduce the performance gap, storage subsystems are under extensive changes, adopting new technologies and adding more layers
into the memory/storage hierarchy. With a deeper memory hierarchy, the data movement complexity of memory systems is increased
significantly, making it harder to utilize the potential of the deep memory and storage hierarchy (DMSH) design.

As we move towards the exascale era, I/O bottleneck is a must to solve performance bottleneck facing the HPC community. DMSHs
with multiple levels of memory/storage layers offer a feasible solution but are very complex to use effectively. Ideally, the
presence of multiple layers of storage should be transparent to applications without having to sacrifice I/O performance. There
is a need to enhance and extend current software systems to support data access and movement transparently and effectively under
DMSHs.

Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) technologies are a set of current I/O solutions addressing the problems in organizing, accessing,
analyzing, and preserving data. HDF5 library is widely popular within the scientific community. Among the high level I/O libraries
used in DOE labs, HDF5 is the undeniable leader with 99% of the share. HDF5 addresses the I/O bottleneck by hiding the complexity
of performing coordinated I/O to single, shared files, and by encapsulating general purpose optimizations. While HDF technologies,
like other existing I/O middleware, are not designed to support DMSHs, its wide popularity and its middleware nature make HDF5 an
ideal candidate to enable, manage, and supervise I/O buffering under DMSHs.

> This project proposes the development of Hermes, a heterogeneous aware, multi-tiered, dynamic, and distributed I/O buffering
> system that will significantly accelerate I/O performance.

This project proposes to extend HDF technologies with the Hermes design. Hermes is new, and the enhancement of HDF5 is new. We
believe that the combination of DMSH I/O buffering and HDF technologies is a reachable practical solution that can efficiently
support scientific discovery.

## Why Hermes?

Hermes will advance HDF5 core technology by developing new buffering algorithms and mechanisms to support:

- **Vertical and Horizontal Buffering in DMSHs**
  - Here vertical means access data to/from different levels locally and horizontal means spread/gather data across remote
    compute nodes
- **Selective Buffering via HDF5**
  - Here selective means some memory layer, e.g. NVMe, only for selected data
- **Dynamic Buffering via Online System Profiling**
  - The buffering schema can be changed dynamically based on messaging traffic
- **Adaptive Buffering via Reinforcement Learning**
  - By learning the application's access pattern, we can adapt prefetching algorithms and cache replacement policies at runtime.

A new, multi-tiered, distributed buffering platform that is:

- Hierarchical
  - Enables, manages, and supervises I/O operations in the Deep Memory and Storage Hierarchy (DMSH)
- Dynamic
  - Offers selective and dynamic layered data placement
- Modular
  - Is modular, extensible, and performance-oriented
- Flexible
  - Supports a wide variety of applications (scientific, BigData, etc)
