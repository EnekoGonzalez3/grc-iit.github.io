## ChronoLog Project Overview

ChronoLog is a scalable, high-performance distributed shared log store designed to handle the
ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of modern activity data. It is tailored for applications
ranging from edge computing to high-performance computing (HPC) systems, offering a
versatile solution for managing log data across diverse domains. Find out more at
[chronolog.dev](https://chronolog.dev).

## Core Features

- **Multi-Tiered Storage**: Leverages multiple storage tiers (e.g., persistent memory, flash storage) to scale log capacity and optimize performance.
- **High Concurrency**: Supports multiple writers and multiple readers (MWMR) for efficient concurrent access to the log.
- **Partial Data Retrieval**: Enables efficient range queries for partial log processing, enhancing data exploration capabilities.
- **Total Ordering**: Guarantees strict ordering of log entries across distributed environments, eliminating the need for costly synchronization.
- **Synchronization-Free**: Employs physical time for log ordering, avoiding expensive synchronization operations.
- **Auto-Tiering**: Automatically and transparently moves log data across storage tiers based on age and access patterns.
- **Elastic I/O**: Adapts to varying I/O workloads, ensuring efficient resource utilization and performance.

## Applicability

ChronoLog is designed to address the challenges of modern applications that generate and
process vast amounts of log data. It is particularly well-suited for:

- **Scientific Applications**: Astrophysics, geoscience, materials science, cosmology, and more.
- **Internet-of-Things (IoT)**: Efficiently stores, indexes, queries, and analyzes data from IoT devices.
- **Financial Applications**: Supports real-time monitoring, time-series analysis, and fraud protection.- HPC Resource Management: Optimizes resource utilization in large-scale HPC systems.
- **System Telemetry and Trace Recording**: Captures and analyzes telemetry data from distributed systems.
- **Application Performance Analysis**: Facilitates performance monitoring and analysis for complex applications.

## Key Innovations

- **Physical Time-Based Ordering**: A novel approach to achieving total ordering in distributed systems without synchronization overhead.
- **3D Log Distribution**: A unique model that distributes log data horizontally across nodes and vertically across storage tiers.
- **Decoupled Server-Pull Architecture**: Separates event ingestion from event persistence for enhanced performance and scalability.

## ChronoLog Release 1.0.0

- **ChronoLog Server**
  - **Implemented Components**: ChronoVisor, ChronoKeeper, and ChronoGraph
  - **Multi-Tiered Distributed Storage**: The fully functional distributed 3-tier log recording system is implemented to efficiently handle and manage log event streams. The system supports configurable time-based log data management.
  - **Event Ordering**: Total log event ordering across the client nodes is guaranteed within the bounds of error inherited from the node synchronization protocol. The client identifiers and the event causality order of the client application are retained. (Pipeline Data Model)
  - **Elasticity**: The system supports dynamic Recording Group membership for ChronoKeeper and ChronoGrapher processes
- **ChronoLog Client API**
  - Multi-threaded ChronoLog Client library implementation in C++ allows for highly concurrent log event ingestion and distributed recording
  - A set of example client applications and a command-line admin tool utilizing the C++ library to simulate various logging workloads
  - Python Bindings for C++ Client API

## Development Team

ChronoLog is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at Illinois Tech and the
University of Chicago.
